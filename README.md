# InformedSearch    

## We implement an AI problem formulation. In AI, a problem is defined as an {Initial state, Goal state/test, Cost function, Actions}    

## We also implement UCS and A* in the context of such a definition.   

We use these implementations and problem formulation to solve the problem of optimally finding the shortest route from City A to City B. The example cities used are conform with the ones listed in Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach (Â£rd edition).
